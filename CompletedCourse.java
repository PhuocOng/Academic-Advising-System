/**
 * The CompletedCourse class allows information about courses taken by a student to be stored and manipulated.
 * Each Course has a department, a course number, a semester taken, a number of credits, and a grade. 
 * Each course also has a competency status field which can be W (writing), Q (quantitatve), S (speaking). 
 * If the course is not a W, Q, or S course its competency field should be X.  Each course also has a group field
 * which can be any of the distAreas SS, SM, AH, LA (or NONE if the course does not carry distArea credit).
 * 
 * Methods are provided to construct a new course, to print a course, and to access any of the courses 
 * instance fields.
